# markdown-in-clojure

There is absolutely no useful code here because I'm using this project as
a learning experience for [Clojure](http://clojure.org/),
[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) and [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository;
2. `lein midje`;
3. Laugh at the implementation.
